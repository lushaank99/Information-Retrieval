Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The smallest planet in the Solar System , Mercury has no natural satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind.
