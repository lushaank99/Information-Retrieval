Earth is the largest and densest of the inner planets, the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed. It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.
